As cloud platforms such as Azure and cloud-native concepts like microservices continue to grow in popularity, there is an increasing need for developers to wield container management skills to optimize efficiency and simplify complex tasks. In this course, learn how to use Docker and the powerful features of Microsoft Azure to build more effective container-based applications.

Join CTO and Microsoft MVP David Okeyode as he explores the fundamentals of containerization, including how to build and ship Docker containers on Azure, and how to successfully run them with ease on the same platform. David shows you how to leverage Azure Container Instances (ACI) as a way of managing containers, sharing practical tips and techniques along the way for networking, storage, and general troubleshooting for commonly encountered problems.
